BIMBlog Posts Guide (Do/Don’t)
================================

Purpose
- Keep posts friendly, skimmable, and bilingual (EN/HE) with minimal friction for future edits.

Structure
- Use the existing post template as reference (see any file under BIMBlog/posts/).
- Include both languages for each heading/paragraph block:
  - English: <h2 class="lang lang-en">...</h2> + <p class="lang lang-en">...</p>
  - Hebrew:  <h2 class="lang lang-he" dir="rtl" style="display:none;">...</h2> + <p class="lang lang-he" dir="rtl" style="display:none;">...</p>
- Keep language toggle compatibility by preserving classes: `lang lang-en` and `lang lang-he`.
- Use `site-navbar` and footer exactly like the template; keep scripts at the bottom.

Tone & Content
- Conversational but professional; short sentences; concrete value.
- Prefer paragraphs over long bullet lists; bullets are okay for 3–5 crisp items only.
- Always open with the pain/context; then the fix; then practical takeaway; short conclusion.

Metadata
- Update `<title>` and `<meta name="description" ...>`.
- Post header must include EN/HE titles and sub-lines with date and read time.
- After creating a post, register it in `BIMBlog/scripts/posts.js` with:
  - title, title_en, title_he
  - date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - excerpt, excerpt_en, excerpt_he
  - tags, tags_he (2–5 each)
  - thumbnail (relative path)
  - url (e.g., `posts/2025-09-21-your-slug.html`)
  - readTime/readTime_en/readTime_he

Do
- Keep each section tight (2–5 sentences).
- Mirror content in both languages; keep meaning consistent, not word-for-word.
- Use semantic headings (h2) to break the flow logically.
- Test locally by opening `BIMBlog/blog.html` and clicking through.

Don’t
- Don’t leave Hebrew sections missing; always include both.
- Don’t overuse bullet lists or nested lists.
- Don’t change the navbar or global script includes.
- Don’t hardcode absolute paths.

Notes
- If you add images, keep them lightweight and optimized; use `loading="lazy"` on inline images.
- For code or terms, wrap with <code>...</code> when needed.
- Keep RTL attributes on Hebrew blocks: `dir="rtl" style="display:none;"`.

Link hygiene 
- When the same external URL is used in both EN/HE text (e.g., Tekla Support), don’t hardcode the URL twice.
- Instead, add `data-tekla-support` (or a similarly named data attribute) to both anchors and set the `href` once via a tiny inline script.
- Support links are styled blue like the contact link via CSS in `BIMBlog/styles/blog.css`:
  .post-content a[href*="support.tekla.com"] { color: #22d3ee; }
